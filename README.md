# digit_recognition
This is a Real Time Project with "MVARO", a huge dataset is given to me in which around 42000 entries are there. I create a digit recognition Machine Learning model using Support Vector Classifier of SVM supervised ML algorithm. This model is able to detect the digit formed by given no. of pixels and also plot that digit as grayscale pixel Image.
